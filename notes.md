# Notes about migrating resource docs

## Todo:

- Convert this text to a Hugo note in inspec-azure:
  - <superscript>*</superscript> For information on how to use filter criteria on plural resources refer to [FilterTable usage](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/blob/master/dev-docs/filtertable-usage.md).
- Possibly migrate that filter table doc to docs.chef.io in the inspec repo.
- Edit install text
- Fix links in readmes
- archetypes
